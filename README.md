# Get Next Line (GNL) Project
- Overview:
This project focuses on creating a simple and efficient utility, Get Next Line (GNL), designed to read and store lines from a file into a buffer in C. The primary objective is to gain proficiency in memory allocation, freeing, and avoiding memory leaks while providing a flexible and reliable solution for handling file input.

# Key Features:
- Get Next Line Functionality:

Reads and stores the next line from a file into a buffer.
- Dynamic Memory Management:

Demonstrates effective memory allocation and freeing techniques.
- Buffer Management:

Efficiently handles dynamic buffer allocation to accommodate varying line lengths.
- Avoids Memory Leaks:

Emphasizes the importance of proper memory deallocation to prevent memory leaks.
- Bonus:

Allows reading lines from multiple files simultaneously, catering to more advanced use cases.
